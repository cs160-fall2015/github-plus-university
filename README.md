======================

This source code goes along with my two blog posts:

- [GitHub + University: How College Coding Assignments Should Work][post1]
- [GitHub + University: A Follow Up][post2]

## Install

To install it, just be sure to have NodeJS installed and run the following:

```bash
$ cd app/
$ npm install
```
## Config

There are a lot of hardcoded strings within the scripts, if I have time, I will
try to remove these.

In addition to the hardcoded strings, a **students.csv** file is required. It
should be a CSV file of the list of students in the class.

It should follow the format below:

```
last_name, first_name, university_id
```

check out the sample [students.csv][students]

## Running

To run it, just run:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

or you might want to look into a tool like [forever][forever] which ensures that
your server won't crash if it has an unexpected error.
